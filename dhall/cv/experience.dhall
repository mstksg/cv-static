                Developed an ensemble-based Machine Learning system for forecasting and
                predicting frequency and intensity of power outages for major utility
                company.  Developed mathematical models based on stochastic principles
                for analysis and pre-processing of data.  Worked with Neural Network,
                Self-Organizing Map, Stochastic models, and ARIMA models to provide a
                ensemble forecast.  Worked also on developing an on-line platform to
                manage updating models and generating predictions as weather data was
                submitted.

                Developed statically verified neural network technology in Haskell for
                the purpose of performant modeling and analysis of climate trends in
                relation to the mid-2010's California drought and the 2015 --- 2016
                season El Ni√±o.  Implemented high-performance recurrent neural networks
                and training algorithms, and integrated modern highly parallelized
                cluster training techniques with an automated operational back-end to
                make confident and validated projections about future climate trends.
