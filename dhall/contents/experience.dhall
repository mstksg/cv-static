                  Developed an ensemble-based Machine Learning system for
                  forecasting and predicting frequency and intensity of power
                  outages for major Energy and Utility company providing for
                  over 3 million people.  Developed mathematical models based on
                  stochastic principles for analysis and pre-processing of data.
                  Worked with Neural Network, Self-Organizing Map, Stochastic
                  models, and ARIMA models to provide a ensemble forecast.
                  Worked also on developing an on-line platform to manage
                  updating models and generating predictions as weather data was
                  submitted.

                  Developed statically verified neural network technology in Haskell for
                  the purpose of performant modeling and analysis of climate trends in
                  relation to the mid-2010's California drought and the 2015 --- 2016
                  season El Ni√±o.  Implemented high-performance recurrent neural networks
                  and training algorithms, and integrated modern highly parallelized
                  cluster training techniques with an automated operational back-end to
                  make confident and validated projections about future climate trends.
