          I'm looking for a place I can apply my passion for finding the *story*
          that data has to tell us.  My experience is in a wide collection of tools
          from *statistics*, *math modeling*, *machine learning*, and *data
          science* --- tools that I have proven effective in taming data in
          geosciences, climate, resource allocation, finance, and
          condensed matter physics.

          As a *scientist and mathematician*, I focus not only on prediction, but also
          in developing full mathematical and data-driven *frameworks* for fully
          *understanding* and *exploring* processes and systems.  As a
          *programmer*, I focus on developing *performant* and *robust* systems
          that are statically *verifiable* and prioritized for long-term
          *maintainability* and extensibility.

          I'm someone who is passionate about *building systems* for conquering data
          and expanding the horizons of what your data can do for you, equipped with
          both the *cutting edge* and the *tried and tested* tools of the trade.
